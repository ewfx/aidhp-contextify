## 🎯 Introduction
The project is about: The Cold Start phase occurs when new customers have just opened their accounts but have no transaction or product purchase history. In this phase, the project will leverage a popularity-based model to recommend the most popular, top-selling products to these customers.

## 💡 Inspiration
The inspiration to create a project on AI-Driven Hyper-Personalization & Recommendations in banking stems from several key factors:

- Increased Competition in the Financial Sector
- Data-Driven Insights
- Improved Customer Retention
- Maximizing Revenue Opportunities
- Efficient Marketing and Product Delivery

## ⚙️ What It Does
The GBDT + LR (Gradient Boosting Decision Tree + Logistic Regression) recommender is a hybrid model that integrates the strengths of both gradient boosting decision trees and logistic regression. It utilizes the powerful feature-learning capabilities of gradient boosting decision trees along with the interpretability and flexibility of logistic regression.

This method takes advantage of both models: the GBDT component captures complex patterns and interactions, while the LR component enhances interpretability and efficiently handles feature engineering. As a result, this hybrid approach often leads to improved recommendation performance and is capable of managing large-scale datasets with high-dimensional features.

In the context of recommendation systems, once the GBDT + LR model is trained, it can be used to generate personalized product recommendations for customers. Given a customer's profile, item features, and user-item interactions, the model predicts the likelihood of user-item preferences. The items with the highest predicted probabilities are then recommended to the customer.
